AWWSEMR (Autonomous Weaponized Writing Style Enforcement Mobile Robot)
======================================================================



AWWSEMR will be a writing style enforcement robot. Its preliminary test environment 
will be my law office. A Word plug-in will detect awful legalese and task the robot 
with a mission. Upon receiving a mission over the wireless network, AWWSEMR will then 
navigate to the appropriate workstation and audibly heckle the guilty party. The first 
prototype design of AWWSEMR consists of a Raspberry Pi single-board Linux computer, 
a magnetometer for indoor navigation, custom circuits for driving motors and handling 
I/O, and a tilt/pan servo mechanism for aiming a laser.
